# Construe

*Construe* is a knowledge-based abductive framework for time series interpretation. It provides a knowledge representation model and a set of algorithms for the interpretation of temporal information, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an attentional mechanism. The framework is fully described in the following paper:

T. Teijeiro, P. FÃ©lix and J.Presedo: *On the adoption of abductive reasoning for time series interpretation*.

In this repository you will find the complete implementation of the data model and the algorithms, as well as a knowledge base for the interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, from the basic waveforms (P, QRS, T) to complex rhythm patterns (Atrial fibrillation, Bigeminy, Trigeminy, Ventricular flutter/fibrillation, etc.). In addition, we provide some utility scripts to reproduce the interpretation of all the ECG strips shown in the paper, and to allow the interpretation of any ECG record in the MIT-BIH format.

## Installation

This project is implemented in pure python, so no installation is required. However, there are strong dependencies with the following python packages:

1. [blist](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blist)
2. [scipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy)
3. [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)
4. [scikit-learn v0.16](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn/0.16.1)
5. [PyWavelets](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyWavelets/)

In addition, to support visualization of the interpretation results and the interpretation tree, the following packages are needed:

6. [matplotlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib)
7. [networkx](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx/)
8. [pygraphviz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz)

Finally, to read ECG signal records it is necessary to have access to a proper installation of the [WFDB software package](http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml).

Once all these dependencies are satisfied, is enough to download the project sources and execute the proper python or bash scripts, as explained below.

## Reproducing the examples in the paper

Use the `run_example.sh` script, selecting the figure for which you want to reproduce the interpretation process:

```
./run_example.sh fig1
```
