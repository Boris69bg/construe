# How to contribute
As an open-source project, *Construe* is open to third party contributions. However, this is a highly experimental project, mainly developed with research purposes, and cannot (yet) be considered an end-user software. Therefore, the codebase is susceptible to major changes that would substantially modify the provided functionality or the design of the underlying algorithms/architecture.

Also notice that *Construe* is licensed under the terms of the [GPL v3 license](LICENSE), so by submitting content to the *Construe* repository, you release your work to the public domain.

The Centro Singular de Investigación en Tecnoloxías da Información da Universidade de Santiago de Compostela ("[CITIUS](https://citius.usc.es/)") requires to have agreements ([CLA](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/citiususc/construe)) with everyone who takes part in this project. This is the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions (in effect, you are giving us a license, but you still own the copyright, so you retain the right to modify your code and use it in other projects).
